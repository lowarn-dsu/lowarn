Type checking errors:
Couldn't match representation of type ‘Variant1’
                         with that of ‘Variant1Wrapper’
  arising from a use of ‘coerceTransformer’
In the first argument of ‘unTransformer’, namely
  ‘(coerceTransformer :: Transformer Variant1 Variant1Wrapper)’
In the expression:
  unTransformer
    (coerceTransformer :: Transformer Variant1 Variant1Wrapper)
    Variant1A
